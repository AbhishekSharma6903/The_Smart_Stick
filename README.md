# The_Smart_Stick
Our IoT device integrates a smart stick with object-detecting sensors, enhancing mobility for the visually impaired. We're dedicated to redefining accessibility.

## Abstract:
The "Smart Stick" prototype integrates ultrasonic sensors and cloud-based communication to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired individuals. Real-time obstacle detection and emergency alerts ensure independence and peace of mind for users and caregivers.

## Introduction:
Visually impaired individuals face challenges in navigating safely. Existing aids offer limited assistance, necessitating comprehensive solutions. The "Smart Stick" aims to bridge this gap by providing real-time assistance and communication tools.

## Project Description:
The "_Smart Stick_" integrates **ultrasonic sensors** and **SOS buttons**, transmitting data to **ThingSpeak** for monitoring and **Blynk** for alerts. An Android app offers real-time tracking. It aims to redefine mobility aid standards for the visually impaired.
